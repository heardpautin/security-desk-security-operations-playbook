## Alignment with IAM, GRC, and Cloud Security

This project demonstrates that:
- Service Desk roles reinforce IAM controls
- Operational tickets become audit evidence
- Identity governance begins at first contact
- Cloud security is only as strong as frontline processes

This repository represents the **operational foundation**
that supports higher-level IAM, GRC, and cloud security roles.
