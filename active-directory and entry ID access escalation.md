# Active Directory / Entra ID Access Escalation

## Service Desk Role
Service Desk Analysts:
- verify requests
- validate approvals
- route changes

They do NOT:
- assign privileged roles
- approve their own changes

---

## Workflow
1. User submits request
2. Analyst validates:
   - request completeness
   - manager approval
3. Determine access type:
   - standard
   - elevated
4. Route to appropriate team

---

## Segregation of Duties
- Requester ≠ Approver ≠ Implementer
- Analyst enforces the workflow but does not own the control

---

## Audit Alignment
Clear separation:
- prevents conflict of interest
- supports SOX, HIPAA, and internal audit expectations
