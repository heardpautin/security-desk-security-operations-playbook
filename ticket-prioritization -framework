# Ticket Prioritization Framework

## Objective

## Priority Levels

### P1 – Major Incident

- Continuous communication
- No unauthorized changes

---

### P2 – High Impact
- Multiple users affected
- Business function degraded

Actions:
- Rapid triage
- Escalate to appropriate support teams
- Document interim workarounds

---

### P3 – Standard Request
- Single user

## Audit & GRC Alignment
Proper prioritization:
- demonstrates operational maturity,
- supports incident reporting,
- and provides defensible evidence during audits.
