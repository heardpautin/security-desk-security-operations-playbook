# Service Desk Security & Operations Playbook

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how a Tier 2 Service Desk Analyst operates within a
regulated enterprise environment, balancing customer support, security controls,
and operational discipline.

Rather than focusing on specific tool screenshots, this project emphasizes:
- decision logic,
- escalation boundaries,
- identity and access safety,
- documentation quality,
- and alignment with IAM, GRC, and cloud security principles.

The workflows modeled here are based on real-world enterprise service desk practices
commonly found in utilities, financial institutions, healthcare, and government environments.

## Scope of This Project
This project models **process and judgment**, not system ownership.

In real environments:
- Service Desk Analysts **do not bypass controls**
- Privileged changes are **escalated, not executed**
- Security controls are **validated, not weakened**

---

## Domains Covered
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Active Directory / Entra ID access handling
- Exchange Online shared mailboxes & distribution lists
- Incident & request prioritization
- Ticket documentation & audit readiness
- Segregation of Duties (SoD)
- Security-first troubleshooting

---

## Why This Matters
Service desks sit at the intersection of:
- user productivity,
- identity security,
- and audit evidence.

This project shows how a service desk role supports:
- governance,
- risk reduction,
- and compliance — even when performing operational tasks.
