# Escalation Boundaries & Operational Discipline

## Why Boundaries Matter
Security incidents often begin with "helpful shortcuts."

This project emphasizes:
- knowing when to stop
- knowing who owns the control
- knowing how to document decisions

---

## Escalate When:
- Privileged access is involved
- MFA integrity is at risk
- Policy exceptions are requested
- Security impact is unclear

---

## North Star Alignment
Strong service desk operations:
- protect IAM controls
- generate clean audit evidence
- reinforce cloud security governance
